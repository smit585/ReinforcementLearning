    "Deep learning has created a significant impact in the field of computer vision,\n",
    "natural language processing, and speech recognition. Due to large amount of data being generated day after day, it could be used to train Deep Neural Networks and is preferred over traditional Machine Learning algorithms for higher performance and precision which has led to various successful commercial products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though Deep learning has been a booming field, there are certain practical aspects of it, which remains a black box. You need to understand that Applied Deep learning is a highly iterative process. THere are various hyperparameters, that are to be kept in mind before training the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "These hyperparameters play a major role in balancing the tradeoffs and fit a good generalization over the entire training dataset. Some of such tradeoff concepts are as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generalization\n",
    "Suppose we have trained a classification model on 10k images with their labels. We test the model and it was able to predict labels with a mindblowing 99% accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, when we try the same model on an unseen data, the accuracy failed to perform well. This is the case of <b> Overfitting</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal while training a network is to have it generalize well over the training data which means capturing the true signal of the data, rather than memorizing the noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, it is termed as <b>\"Goodness of Fit\"</b> which refers to how well our predicted values match to the true values\n"
